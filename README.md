# E-Commerce Customer Segmentation
Unlocking Customer Insights: Enhancing E-Commerce Success with Data-Driven Segmentation and Personalized Marketing Strategies


## 📌 **Project Overview**
This project focuses on segmenting customers of an e-commerce platform based on their purchasing behavior using transactional data from a UK-based retailer (2010–2011). The goal is to create customer segments to enhance marketing strategies, drive personalized engagement, and recommend products to boost sales.


## 🎯 **Objectives**
1. Clean and preprocess the dataset for analysis.
2. Engineer customer-centric features such as `Total_Spend`, `Recency`, and `Purchase_Frequency`.
3. Segment customers using the K-Means clustering algorithm.
4. Analyze clusters to identify customer profiles.
5. Develop marketing strategies tailored to each segment.
